## Professional Engagement

PressClubs.tv is a multilingual international media initiative operating within a cross-border dialogue and peace-building framework between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

The platform serves as an analytical and informational publication space supporting expert dialogue and structured multilingual public communication.

This was a paid professional engagement with full end-to-end ownership.

I was initially commissioned to develop a new visual identity and logo concept. Following approval of the brand direction, the engagement scope expanded to full architectural restructuring, CMS stabilization, and operational recovery of the WordPress platform.

I acted as the sole executor of all visual, structural, technical, and CMS-related implementation, working directly in strategic alignment with the co-founder.

Role: Independent Digital & Platform Lead  
Scope: Brand Identity + Full Platform Reconstruction

## Brand Identity Development

The visual identity was developed prior to the technical restructuring phase.

The new logo concept reflects dialogue, balance, and cross-border communication, modernizing legacy elements while preserving conceptual continuity with the initiative’s mission.
