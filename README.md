## Professional Engagement

PressClubs.tv is a multilingual international media initiative operating within a cross-border dialogue and peace-building framework between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

The platform serves as an analytical and informational publication space supporting expert dialogue and structured multilingual public communication.

This was a paid professional engagement with full end-to-end ownership.

I was initially commissioned to develop a new visual identity and logo concept. Following approval of the brand direction, the engagement scope expanded to full architectural restructuring, CMS stabilization, and operational recovery of the WordPress platform.

I acted as the sole executor of all visual, structural, technical, and CMS-related implementation, working directly in strategic alignment with the co-founder.

Role: Independent Digital & Platform Lead  
Scope: Brand Identity + Full Platform Reconstruction  
Execution Model: Sole Contributor

- Integrated latest publications dynamically into homepage layout for improved visibility
- Removed template-based placeholder sections and redundant theme blocks
- Standardized internal linking logic across sections
- Improved content discoverability through visual categorization and color-coded badges
- Ensured multilingual consistency in navigation and structural hierarchy
- Preserved intentional cross-platform routing for extended archival and expert materials hosted within affiliated initiative platforms
- Maintained clear separation between locally hosted editorial content and externally hosted program archives within the partner ecosystem

## Platform Evolution

### Before

The homepage and structural layout relied on default theme elements and contained placeholder sections not aligned with the initiative’s analytical focus.

- Template-based layout with limited editorial prioritization
- Inconsistent multilingual presentation
- Non-functional or partially functional navigation elements
- Generic theme styling without strong visual differentiation between content categories
- Lack of structured homepage integration of Dialogue and Analysis sections

### After

The homepage was fully restructured into a purpose-driven editorial interface reflecting the initiative’s mission and content priorities.

- Integrated latest publications from Dialogue and Analysis sections directly into homepage feed
- Implemented color-coded category badges to strengthen visual identity recognition
- Removed template placeholders and non-relevant theme blocks
- Introduced structured content grid and improved visual hierarchy
- Refined spacing and layout for a cleaner, more professional presentation
- Ensured fully functional internal routing and multilingual consistency

## Brand Identity Development

The visual identity was developed prior to the technical restructuring phase.

The new logo concept reflects dialogue, balance, and cross-border communication, modernizing legacy elements while preserving conceptual continuity with the initiative’s mission.
