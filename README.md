# PressClubs.tv – End-to-End Platform Redevelopment & Brand Transformation

## Professional Engagement

PressClubs.tv is a multilingual international media initiative focused on dialogue and peace-building between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

This was a paid professional engagement with full end-to-end ownership.

I was initially commissioned to develop a new visual identity and logo concept for the initiative. Following approval of the brand direction, the scope expanded to complete architectural restructuring, CMS stabilization, and operational recovery of the WordPress platform.

All visual, structural, technical, and CMS-related implementation was executed independently by me, in direct strategic collaboration and alignment with the co-founder.

Role: Independent Digital & Platform Lead  
Scope: Brand Identity + Full Platform Reconstruction

## Brand Identity Development

The visual identity was developed prior to the technical restructuring phase.

The new logo concept reflects dialogue, balance, and cross-border communication, modernizing legacy elements while preserving conceptual continuity with the initiative’s mission.
